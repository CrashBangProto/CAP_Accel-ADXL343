#Toadstool-Accel ADXL343

**Toadstool Cap - ADXL343 Accelerometer**

The Toadstool family is made up of breadboard-friendly prototyping boards that house a microcontroller, and modules called *Caps* that connect using a standard header.  The prototyping board is analagous to an Arduino/Launchpad and the Cap analagous to a shield/boosterpack.

This repository contains the schematics for the **Toadstool-Accel ADXL343 Cap**, a 3-axis Digital MEMS Accelerometer module that connects to  Toadstool prototyping boards using the common header.  The Analog Devices ADXL343 chip does all the work.

The boards were layed out using [KiCad](http://www.kicad-pcb.org) - KiCad is open source and awesome.

There are a number of other CrashBangProto respositories containing the schematics for other Toadstool boards and Caps, as well as sample code to get you up and running.

Visit the [Toadstool Webpages](http://www.crash-bang.com/projects/toadstool/) for more information on the project.
